# Architecture

## Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

I enjoyed implementing all the different frontend development techniques during this course. Express was a simple and effective method of using routing and controllers to build off templates. It is on the server side which means that the page needs to be refreshed to get any new or up to date information. This method is good but can be more intensive and less user friendly.
JavaScript helped make the pages interactive and improved the UI and was able to build off the features that Node.js provided. SPA is where the application really took off however. The initial load time is longer but the 
app is overall faster and creates a seemless user experience as the page updates without needing to refresh. This is where React is used to create complex and dynamic content.
While they all are used in web development and contribute to the overall web experience they have key differences. Express is server-side and SPA use JavaScript on the client-side. 

## Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

A few reasons the backend used a NoSQL MongoDB are: 
* Scalability : Can scale across mulitple servers and can handle large amounts of data and traffic.
* Flexibility : MongoDB is schemelesss and can modify the data as application evolves.
* Performance : High-speed data integration and retrieval, which makes complex queries quickly.
* Availability : Built in replication and automatic failover capabilities.
* Cost-effective: Open source and free to use.

# Functionality

## How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notattion) is a format in which JavaScript commands can be parsed. JavaScript is a programming language. JSON is a subset of the JavaScript
language and ties in exchanging data and commands between the frontend and the backend.

## Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

In this full stack process I restructed the way that the database was read. This improved the functionality as it could be dynamically changed with the admin SPA or through the database itself, rather than having to write
the code each time.

# Testing

## Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

Methods, endpoints, and security are all very important to the overall health of a web application. Methods are the functions and ability of a application to work. Endpoints 
are the end of a communication channel. I.E. the server or the client. Security is the ability to prevent unwanted actions from happening.

# Reflection

## How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

This course has helped me further understand the ability to become a full-stack developer. I have developed and grown in my skills with databases, web design, and JavaScript. I have a better understanding
of how many applications have strengths and weaknesses. This is very helpful as a Computer Scientist.
